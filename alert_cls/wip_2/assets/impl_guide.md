## 🔬 Clustering Algorithm Selection Logic

### How Auto-Selection Works

```python
for each algorithm in [K-Means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical]:
    1. Run clustering
    2. Get cluster labels
    3. Validate:
       - More than 1 cluster
       - Not too many noise points (< 30% for DBSCAN)
    4. Compute silhouette score
    5. Track best score

Select algorithm with highest silhouette score
```

### When Each Algorithm Wins

**K-Means Wins When:**
- Alerts form well-separated, spherical groups
- Similar cluster sizes
- Clear category/subcategory divisions
- Example: 20 CPU alerts, 20 Memory alerts, 20 Network alerts

**DBSCAN Wins When:**
- Alerts have varying densities
- Many outlier/unique alerts
- Arbitrary-shaped clusters
- Example: 100 common alerts + 20 rare edge cases

**Hierarchical Wins When:**
- Natural taxonomic structure
- Nested groupings make sense
- Service hierarchies reflected in alerts
- Example: App errors → DB errors → Storage errors (cascade)

### Silhouette Score Interpretation

```
Score Range   Interpretation           Action
-----------   ----------------------   -------------------
0.7 - 1.0     Strong separation        ✅ Excellent clustering
0.5 - 0.7     Reasonable structure     ✅ Good clustering
0.3 - 0.5     Weak but present         ⚠️  Acceptable, monitor
0.0 - 0.3     Minimal structure        ⚠️  Consider tuning
< 0.0         No meaningful structure  ❌ Re-engineer features
```

**Typical Range for Alert Data:** 0.3 - 0.6 (acceptable)

## 🎛️ Tuning Guide

### Configuration Constants (Lines 35-39)

```python
class ComprehensiveAlertConsolidator:
    # Tunable parameters
    TIME_WINDOW_MINUTES = 5              # ← Adjust duplicate time window
    MIN_MATCH_SCORE = 2                  # ← Stricter/looser fallback mapping
    DUPLICATE_THRESHOLD = 5              # ← More/less aggressive deduplication
    DESCRIPTION_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD = 0.7  # ← Text similarity sensitivity
    MIN_CLUSTERING_SAMPLES = 10          # ← Minimum alerts for clustering
```

### Tuning Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Too Many Duplicates Marked

**Symptom:** Deduplication rate > 50%, losing real alerts

**Solution:**
```python
DUPLICATE_THRESHOLD = 6  # Increase from 5 (stricter)
DESCRIPTION_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD = 0.8  # Increase from 0.7 (stricter)
```

#### Scenario 2: Missing Duplicates

**Symptom:** Same alerts appearing multiple times

**Solution:**
```python
DUPLICATE_THRESHOLD = 4  # Decrease from 5 (looser)
TIME_WINDOW_MINUTES = 10  # Increase from 5 (wider window)
```

#### Scenario 3: Too Many Unmapped Alerts

**Symptom:** Unmapped rate > 15%

**Solution:**
```python
MIN_MATCH_SCORE = 1  # Decrease from 2 (allow namespace-only or cluster-only match)
```

#### Scenario 4: Too Many Small Clusters

**Symptom:** Lots of 1-2 alert clusters

**Solution:**
```python
# In _apply_clustering() method, line 723
best_k = self._find_optimal_k(max_k=10)  # Reduce from 20

# Or use DBSCAN with larger eps
eps = self._estimate_dbscan_eps() * 1.5  # Line 735
```

#### Scenario 5: Too Few Clusters

**Symptom:** Clusters have 100+ alerts, hard to analyze

**Solution:**
```python
# In _apply_clustering() method
best_k = self._find_optimal_k(max_k=30)  # Increase from 20
```

## 🔄 Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Memory Saturation Incident

**Input Alerts (50 total):**
```
Service A: MemoryHigh (10 alerts from 10 pods)
Service B: MemoryHigh (8 alerts from 8 pods)
Service C: MemoryHigh (12 alerts from 12 pods)
Service D: OOMKilled (5 alerts)
Service E: MemoryAnomaly (15 alerts)
```

**Processing:**

**Phase 4 (Initial Consolidation):**
- If services A-E are related → Merged into 1 group
- If unrelated → 5 separate groups

**Phase 5 (Feature Engineering):**
All 50 alerts have:
- `is_saturation_memory = 1`
- `alert_category_encoded = 1` (saturation)
- `alert_subcategory_encoded = 5` (memory)

**Phase 6 (Clustering):**
High probability all 50 cluster together (similar feature vectors)

**Phase 7 (Deduplication):**
- 10 pods of Service A → 1-2 representative alerts
- Similar for B, C, D, E
- Final: ~10-15 unique alerts

**Output:**
```
Cluster ID: 7
Alert Count: 50 → 12 (after dedup)
Primary Category: saturation
Primary Subcategory: memory
Primary Service: Service A
Related Services: B, C, D, E

Operator Insight: "Platform-wide memory saturation incident"
Action: Check memory limits, consider scale-up
```

---

### Example 2: Service Chain Cascade

**Input Alerts:**
```
Database (upstream): 5 connection_pool_exhausted alerts
API Service (mid): 20 timeout alerts
Frontend (downstream): 30 slow_response alerts
```

**Processing:**

**Phase 3 (Graph Enrichment):**
```
Database: 
  - out_degree = 15 (called by many)
  - dependency_direction = +15 (highly depended upon)
  - pagerank = 0.08 (important)

API:
  - in_degree = 1 (calls Database)
  - out_degree = 10 (called by frontends)
  - dependency_direction = +9

Frontend:
  - in_degree = 1 (calls API)
  - out_degree = 0
  - dependency_direction = -1
```

**Phase 4 (Initial Consolidation):**
All three services grouped (related in graph)

**Phase 6 (Clustering):**
May split into 2-3 clusters based on alert types

**Phase 7 (Deduplication):**
- Database: 5 → 2 alerts
- API: 20 → 5 alerts
- Frontend: 30 → 8 alerts

**Output:**
```
Cluster ID: 3
Alert Count: 55 → 15 (after dedup)
Services: Database (root cause), API, Frontend
Pattern: Cascade failure

Root Cause Analysis:
  1. Database connection_pool_exhausted (upstream)
  2. API timeouts (consequence)
  3. Frontend slow_response (downstream effect)

Action: Increase database connection pool
```

## 🎓 Advanced Techniques

### Technique 1: Feature Selection

If clustering quality is poor, try reducing features:

```python
from sklearn.feature_selection import SelectKBest, f_classif

# Select top 20 features
selector = SelectKBest(f_classif, k=20)
X_selected = selector.fit_transform(
    self.feature_matrix_scaled, 
    self.alerts_df['initial_group_id']
)

# Use X_selected for clustering instead
```

### Technique 2: Ensemble Clustering

Combine multiple clustering results:

```python
from scipy.stats import mode

# Get labels from all algorithms
kmeans_labels = self.clustering_results['kmeans']['labels']
dbscan_labels = self.clustering_results['dbscan']['labels']
hier_labels = self.clustering_results['hierarchical']['labels']

# Ensemble: Majority vote
all_labels = np.vstack([kmeans_labels, dbscan_labels, hier_labels])
ensemble_labels, _ = mode(all_labels, axis=0)
```

### Technique 3: Hierarchical Grouping

For better interpretability, create 2-level hierarchy:

```python
# Level 1: Broad categories (3-5 clusters)
level1_kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=5)
level1_labels = level1_kmeans.fit_predict(features)

# Level 2: Within each level1 cluster, sub-cluster
level2_labels = []
for cluster_id in range(5):
    cluster_mask = level1_labels == cluster_id
    cluster_features = features[cluster_mask]
    
    if len(cluster_features) > 5:
        sub_kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=min(3, len(cluster_features)//2))
        sub_labels = sub_kmeans.fit_predict(cluster_features)
        level2_labels.append(sub_labels)
```

## 🔬 Clustering Algorithm Selection Logic

### How Auto-Selection Works

```python
for each algorithm in [K-Means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical]:
    1. Run clustering
    2. Get cluster labels
    3. Validate:
       - More than 1 cluster
       - Not too many noise points (< 30% for DBSCAN)
    4. Compute silhouette score
    5. Track best score

Select algorithm with highest silhouette score
```

### When Each Algorithm Wins

**K-Means Wins When:**
- Alerts form well-separated, spherical groups
- Similar cluster sizes
- Clear category/subcategory divisions
- Example: 20 CPU alerts, 20 Memory alerts, 20 Network alerts

**DBSCAN Wins When:**
- Alerts have varying densities
- Many outlier/unique alerts
- Arbitrary-shaped clusters
- Example: 100 common alerts + 20 rare edge cases

**Hierarchical Wins When:**
- Natural taxonomic structure
- Nested groupings make sense
- Service hierarchies reflected in alerts
- Example: App errors → DB errors → Storage errors (cascade)

### Silhouette Score Interpretation

```
Score Range   Interpretation           Action
-----------   ----------------------   -------------------
0.7 - 1.0     Strong separation        ✅ Excellent clustering
0.5 - 0.7     Reasonable structure     ✅ Good clustering
0.3 - 0.5     Weak but present         ⚠️  Acceptable, monitor
0.0 - 0.3     Minimal structure        ⚠️  Consider tuning
< 0.0         No meaningful structure  ❌ Re-engineer features
```

**Typical Range for Alert Data:** 0.3 - 0.6 (acceptable)

## 🎛️ Tuning Guide

### Configuration Constants (Lines 35-39)

```python
class ComprehensiveAlertConsolidator:
    # Tunable parameters
    TIME_WINDOW_MINUTES = 5              # ← Adjust duplicate time window
    MIN_MATCH_SCORE = 2                  # ← Stricter/looser fallback mapping
    DUPLICATE_THRESHOLD = 5              # ← More/less aggressive deduplication
    DESCRIPTION_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD = 0.7  # ← Text similarity sensitivity
    MIN_CLUSTERING_SAMPLES = 10          # ← Minimum alerts for clustering
```

### Tuning Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Too Many Duplicates Marked

**Symptom:** Deduplication rate > 50%, losing real alerts

**Solution:**
```python
DUPLICATE_THRESHOLD = 6  # Increase from 5 (stricter)
DESCRIPTION_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD = 0.8  # Increase from 0.7 (stricter)
```

#### Scenario 2: Missing Duplicates

**Symptom:** Same alerts appearing multiple times

**Solution:**
```python
DUPLICATE_THRESHOLD = 4  # Decrease from 5 (looser)
TIME_WINDOW_MINUTES = 10  # Increase from 5 (wider window)
```

#### Scenario 3: Too Many Unmapped Alerts

**Symptom:** Unmapped rate > 15%

**Solution:**
```python
MIN_MATCH_SCORE = 1  # Decrease from 2 (allow namespace-only or cluster-only match)
```

#### Scenario 4: Too Many Small Clusters

**Symptom:** Lots of 1-2 alert clusters

**Solution:**
```python
# In _apply_clustering() method, line 723
best_k = self._find_optimal_k(max_k=10)  # Reduce from 20

# Or use DBSCAN with larger eps
eps = self._estimate_dbscan_eps() * 1.5  # Line 735
```

#### Scenario 5: Too Few Clusters

**Symptom:** Clusters have 100+ alerts, hard to analyze

**Solution:**
```python
# In _apply_clustering() method
best_k = self._find_optimal_k(max_k=30)  # Increase from 20
```

## 🔄 Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Memory Saturation Incident

**Input Alerts (50 total):**
```
Service A: MemoryHigh (10 alerts from 10 pods)
Service B: MemoryHigh (8 alerts from 8 pods)
Service C: MemoryHigh (12 alerts from 12 pods)
Service D: OOMKilled (5 alerts)
Service E: MemoryAnomaly (15 alerts)
```

**Processing:**

**Phase 4 (Initial Consolidation):**
- If services A-E are related → Merged into 1 group
- If unrelated → 5 separate groups

**Phase 5 (Feature Engineering):**
All 50 alerts have:
- `is_saturation_memory = 1`
- `alert_category_encoded = 1` (saturation)
- `alert_subcategory_encoded = 5` (memory)

**Phase 6 (Clustering):**
High probability all 50 cluster together (similar feature vectors)

**Phase 7 (Deduplication):**
- 10 pods of Service A → 1-2 representative alerts
- Similar for B, C, D, E
- Final: ~10-15 unique alerts

**Output:**
```
Cluster ID: 7
Alert Count: 50 → 12 (after dedup)
Primary Category: saturation
Primary Subcategory: memory
Primary Service: Service A
Related Services: B, C, D, E

Operator Insight: "Platform-wide memory saturation incident"
Action: Check memory limits, consider scale-up
```

---

### Example 2: Service Chain Cascade

**Input Alerts:**
```
Database (upstream): 5 connection_pool_exhausted alerts
API Service (mid): 20 timeout alerts
Frontend (downstream): 30 slow_response alerts
```

**Processing:**

**Phase 3 (Graph Enrichment):**
```
Database: 
  - out_degree = 15 (called by many)
  - dependency_direction = +15 (highly depended upon)
  - pagerank = 0.08 (important)

API:
  - in_degree = 1 (calls Database)
  - out_degree = 10 (called by frontends)
  - dependency_direction = +9

Frontend:
  - in_degree = 1 (calls API)
  - out_degree = 0
  - dependency_direction = -1
```

**Phase 4 (Initial Consolidation):**
All three services grouped (related in graph)

**Phase 6 (Clustering):**
May split into 2-3 clusters based on alert types

**Phase 7 (Deduplication):**
- Database: 5 → 2 alerts
- API: 20 → 5 alerts
- Frontend: 30 → 8 alerts

**Output:**
```
Cluster ID: 3
Alert Count: 55 → 15 (after dedup)
Services: Database (root cause), API, Frontend
Pattern: Cascade failure

Root Cause Analysis:
  1. Database connection_pool_exhausted (upstream)
  2. API timeouts (consequence)
  3. Frontend slow_response (downstream effect)

Action: Increase database connection pool
```

## 🎓 Advanced Techniques

### Technique 1: Feature Selection

If clustering quality is poor, try reducing features:

```python
from sklearn.feature_selection import SelectKBest, f_classif

# Select top 20 features
selector = SelectKBest(f_classif, k=20)
X_selected = selector.fit_transform(
    self.feature_matrix_scaled, 
    self.alerts_df['initial_group_id']
)

# Use X_selected for clustering instead
```

### Technique 2: Ensemble Clustering

Combine multiple clustering results:

```python
from scipy.stats import mode

# Get labels from all algorithms
kmeans_labels = self.clustering_results['kmeans']['labels']
dbscan_labels = self.clustering_results['dbscan']['labels']
hier_labels = self.clustering_results['hierarchical']['labels']

# Ensemble: Majority vote
all_labels = np.vstack([kmeans_labels, dbscan_labels, hier_labels])
ensemble_labels, _ = mode(all_labels, axis=0)
```

### Technique 3: Hierarchical Grouping

For better interpretability, create 2-level hierarchy:

```python
# Level 1: Broad categories (3-5 clusters)
level1_kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=5)
level1_labels = level1_kmeans.fit_predict(features)

# Level 2: Within each level1 cluster, sub-cluster
level2_labels = []
for cluster_id in range(5):
    cluster_mask = level1_labels == cluster_id
    cluster_features = features[cluster_mask]
    
    if len(cluster_features) > 5:
        sub_kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=min(3, len(cluster_features)//2))
        sub_labels = sub_kmeans.fit_predict(cluster_features)
        level2_labels.append(sub_labels)
```
