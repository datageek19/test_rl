UHC internal / external latency task for all submitters:

	- columns in CST are : 
		MLLP DTM in encounter tables 
		ECDH_adt_eventhub_dtm in encounter
		ECDH_IRSI_process_dtm in encounter
	
	- columns are in UTC:
		-ECDH_ETL_load_dtm
		- ECDH_load_dtm, 
		- ECDH_update_dtm
		
	when messages comes through, it populated to load_dtm/update_dtm;
	
	we use update_dtm in utc time zones
	
	MLLP -> Evenhub_dtm - > IRIS_process_dtm -> ETL_load_dtm -> ecdh_update_dtm
	
	computer latency between:
		1. MLLP_dtm to ecdh_eventhub_dtm
		2. ecdh_eventhub_dtm to ecdh_iris_process_dtm
		3. ecdh_iris_process_dtm to etl_load_dtm
		4. ecdh_load_dtm to ecdh_update_dtm

	overall latency from MLLP dtm -> ECDH_update-dtm
	
	use encounter and org tables to get latency, where pick all hostpital names from names column in org tables
	
	expected output:
		90 days interval for all adt by submitters
		
todo:
	- in cte tables, do those steps:
			step1:	convert ECDH_MLLP_DTM, ECDH_ADT_EVENT_HUB_DTM, ECDH_IRIS_PROCESS_DTM TO UTC TIME ZONE BY DOING OFFSET VALUE CHECKING AND DO CONVERSION
			step 2: need to compute latency from ECDH_MLLP_DTM to ECDH_ADT_EVENT_HUB_DTM (latency_1)
			step 3: also need to compute latency from ECDH_ADT_EVENT_HUB_DTM to ECDH_IRIS_PROCESS_DTM (latency_2)
			step 4: also need to compute latency from ECDH_IRIS_PROCESS_DTM to ECDH_ETL_LOAD_DTM (latency_3)
			step 5: also need to compute latency from ECDH_ETL_LOAD_DTM to ECDH_UPDATE_DTM (latency_4)
			step 6: take average of step1, step2, ste3, step4 as overall average internal latency	(avg_internal_latency)
	- then join cte table which is encounter table (if encounter tabel can be joined directly with org tables); if not, cte first joined with patient tables first then join with org tables
	- then group by name column in org table ( which is hostpital names ) by step1, step2, step3, ste4, step5, step6; filter by ADT only
	
		
=========================================================================
external latency for UHC for all adts:

	messages_header columns in encounter tables
	zip code in org table; bring hostpital name in name column in org tables

	from messages_header to received_dtm, use datalieage table where you pick up received_dtm
	
	messages_header to received_dtm ( we can control received_dtm as utc time zone), no worry about changing time zone, keep it as it is;
